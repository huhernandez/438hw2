# Hw2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Theme
Images are being pulled from Giphy and Getty using their respective APIs. The theme is records and funk. Click the 'About' link to see the image and gif animation. The search term for the Getty images is 'funky' and the term used for Giphy is 'records'.

## Engineering principles
This assignment taught me how microservices can be independent, as far as each API call being independent from each other. If one server goes down, the other API will still be available and vice versa. 

## Improvement/ Future Features
I would like to remove some of the text and have a user input a term in a search field so the user can choose what images to display on the webpage.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
